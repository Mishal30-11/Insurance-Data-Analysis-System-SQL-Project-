# 🏦 Insurance-Data-Analysis-System (SQL + Power BI Project)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Insurance Management System** is a SQL and Power BI-based project designed to manage customers, insurance products, policies, and premium payments.  
It provides an efficient way to analyze data, generate insights, and streamline insurance policy management.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Insurance companies often struggle with handling vast amounts of customer and policy data efficiently.  
Manual processes lead to data redundancy, inconsistent records, and delays in premium tracking.  
This project solves these challenges by building a **centralized SQL database** that automates policy management, premium calculations, and customer record maintenance — ensuring accuracy, reliability, and analytical insight.


### This project demonstrates:
- 🧩 Database design and normalization  
- 🧮 SQL queries, joins, and stored procedures  
- ⚙️ Views, triggers, and constraints  
- 📊 Power BI dashboards for analytical insights
